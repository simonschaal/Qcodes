The deprecated support for enabling OpenCensus based telemetry has been removed.
QCoDeS will now warn if you try to enable OpenCensus based telemetry in the config.
Users are encouraged to roll out their own telemetry solution if they need it based
on OpenTelemetry. This also means that the `qcodes[opencensus]` install target has been removed.
The unused method `filter_out_telemetry_log_records` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
